# GenshinArtifactOptim-maybe
This might turn into an optimizer, but it might also be a Naive Bayes training simulator. Or maybe both, who knows.

Honestly no clue where this is going yet.

`artifact.make_arti()` runs really fast :) (~130 micros)... actually if i think really hard we should be able to speed it up even more; basically we just generating 11 random numbers...

Damage is kiiinda fucked but okay?
